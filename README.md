**RC Boat Control System**

**Overview**:

This project focuses on the design and development of a long-range, high-speed RC boat, complete with a custom board and a Python driver to control it using a PS4 controller. The core of the system is built on the NodeMCU platform, providing a versatile and reliable foundation for seamless communication and control.

**Features**:

**Custom Board Design**: A meticulously designed board to meet the specific requirements of a long-range, high-speed RC boat. The board is equipped with essential components for efficient control and communication.

**NodeMCU Integration**: Leveraging the power of NodeMCU for seamless connectivity, ensuring reliable communication between the boat and the control system.

**PC Python Driver**: A Python driver developed to interface with the NodeMCU-based boat. This driver enables communication with a PS4 controller, offering a user-friendly and intuitive control experience.

**PS4 Controller Support**: The system is designed to be controlled using a PS4 controller, providing a familiar and ergonomic interface for users.

**Prerequisites**:
